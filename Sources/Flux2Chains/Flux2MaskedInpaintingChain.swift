// Flux2MaskedInpaintingChain.swift — RePaint-style masked inpainting
// Copyright 2025 Vincent Gourbin
//
// FLUX.2 has no dedicated Fill checkpoint (as of 2026-05). Diffusers'
// `FluxFillPipeline` channel-cat approach requires fine-tuned input channels,
// which FLUX.2 base/distilled doesn't have. The classical RePaint trick gets
// us most of the way for free: at every denoising step the region OUTSIDE the
// user mask is overwritten with the original-image latent re-noised to the
// current sigma. Only the inside-mask region accumulates new content.
//
// Implemented as a `Flux2Chain` using the `onStep:` hook on the standard T2I
// generation path — so progress callbacks, profiling, memory caps, and
// scheduler overrides all behave exactly like a normal generate() call.
