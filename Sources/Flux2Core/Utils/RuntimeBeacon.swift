// RuntimeBeacon.swift - Opt-in presence beacon for external activity monitors
// Copyright 2026 Vincent Gourbin

import Foundation
import os

/// Opt-in beacon advertising heavy GPU/memory activity (generation, training,
/// model loading) to external monitors such as SiliconScope.
///
/// When enabled, each heavy operation writes a small JSON manifest to
/// `~/Library/Application Support/ai-runtime-beacons/<pid>-<id>.json` for its
/// duration and deletes it when the operation ends (including on error, via
/// `defer` at every call site). Nothing is ever written unless the host
/// explicitly opts in.
///
/// ## Enabling
/// ```swift
/// RuntimeBeacon.isEnabled = true   // from code
/// ```
/// or set the environment variable `FLUX2_RUNTIME_BEACON=1` (used by the CLI's
/// `--beacon` flag as well).
///
/// ## Manifest schema (version 1)
/// The format is deliberately runtime-agnostic — same convention as
/// ltx-video-swift-mlx's RuntimeBeacon — so monitors only need one reader:
/// ```json
/// {
///   "version": 1,
///   "pid": 1234,
///   "runtime": "flux-2-swift-mlx",
///   "displayName": "FLUX.2",
///   "task": "generate",
///   "model": "klein-9b",
///   "phase": "denoising",
///   "step": 3,
///   "totalSteps": 4,
///   "startedAt": "2026-07-16T09:00:00Z",
///   "updatedAt": "2026-07-16T09:00:42Z"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Crash safety
/// A `kill -9` can leave a manifest behind; both `begin(task:model:)` and
/// well-behaved consumers treat a manifest whose `pid` is dead as garbage and
/// delete it, so stale files never outlive the next beacon-enabled run.
///
/// - Note: Sandboxed apps write inside their container, where external
///   monitors cannot see the manifest. The beacon is a no-op in practice
///   there; it targets CLI tools and non-sandboxed apps.
